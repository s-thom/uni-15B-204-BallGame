# Ball Game

### Stuart Thomson & Tim Hampton

This project was started before the specification was released. Hopefully that doesn't come around to bite us.

#### Development

Have a look at the list of things in `TODO.md`. Pick one!

Create a branch for the part you're working on. When ready, create a merge request, and merge into `master`.

If there are merge conflicts, resolve them. Don't be afraid to ask the other person to see if there's anything that needs to be discussed.
